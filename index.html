      Madame Ji,<br><br>
      Finally Vai Ka birthday is here 💃💃💃 and i really can't wait to see you again. The fact is that we found our way through long talks and shared meals, and I am not really sure how but we clicked instantly after not being close for years now.
      Tiramisu that somehow became our thing. KFC burgers that never disappointed (once it did tho), even when we said we should cut back.
      McD meals that left us joking about the weight we were definitely not losing. Junk food, laughter, time that slipped by too fast but left its mark in the best ways.<br><br>
      So here’s to you. To another year of everything that makes you, you. To more laughter, more meals, more quiet unspoken understandings and more spoken misunderstandings hehe. And most of all, to the simple fact that I’m grateful we met. There's so much more I want to tell you but maybe next time ( or maybe in the 2nd letter down there ).<3<br>
      Yours Chirkut :)
